Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.\r\n\r\n2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each \r\nmeasurement. \r\n\r\n3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\r\n\r\n4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. \r\n\r\n5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set \r\nwith the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\r\n\r\n## Code Book\r\nThe code book describing the tidy data produced is in CodeBook.md. Portions of\r\nthe code book are generated using R code in the generate\\_codebook.R script.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-000000-01","note":"Don't delete this file!
