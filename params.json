Loads the training (`train/X_train.txt`) and test (`test/X_test.txt`) \r\nmeasurements\r\n\r\n2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each \r\nmeasurement using the feature names in `features.txt`\r\n\r\n3. Loads the subject data from `train/subject_train.txt` and \r\n`test/subject_test.txt`, and combines it with the measurements\r\n\r\n4. Loads the activity identifier from `train/y_train.txt` and `test/y_test.txt`\r\nand combines it with the measurements\r\n\r\n5. Loads the activity labels from `activity_labels.txt` and combines it with \r\nthe measurements to ensure that the activity has a friendly label\r\n\r\n6. From the data set in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set \r\nwith the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\r\n\r\n## Code Book\r\nThe code book describing the tidy data produced is in CodeBook.md. Portions of\r\nthe code book are generated using R code in the generate\\_codebook.R script.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-21583527-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
